                             Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software and use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you
know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities
for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
rights that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

Developers that use the GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to use the software under certain conditions.

This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit
to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered
by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it
to your programs, too.
